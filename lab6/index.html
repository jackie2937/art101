		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<div class="box1">Coloring and filling in certain borders were challenging. There were a lot of things we had to change from lab 5 to fit lab 6.</div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<div class="box1">A few lines were missing semi colons and also had extra quotes added on accident. The website loading was slow again, so it took more time to see the results.</div>
